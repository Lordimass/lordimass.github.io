        <h1> Welcome to Lordimass.net :D </h1>
        <p> Hi! I'm Lordimass and I do stuff. I like to code, draw, and play games with friends.</p>
        <p> 
            I'm part of a community called <i>Reformation</i>, which you can read more about on <a href="https://reformation.wiki.gg" target=”_blank”>our wiki</a>, but in essence, we do lots of projects and generally try and have fun. Part of that includes our annual 24hr charity streams which I am very proud to be the lead organiser of.
            If you want to read more about those fundraising events, check out their website at <a href="https://reformationfundraising.com" target=”_blank”>reformationfundraising.com</a> (I like having lots of websites ok?).
         </p>
        <p> Anyways, the point of this website is just to be a little hub for myself and what I do, rather than the Reformation community as a whole, and to showcase some of my work and what I do as a human bean.</p>
